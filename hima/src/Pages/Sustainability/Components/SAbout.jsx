        An important part of a good and healthy indoor climate is efficient
        sound absorpon. It is an important factor in schools, kindergartens,
        sports centres and work places where the noise level can be
        considerable.
        <br />
        <br />
        A high level of noise over a short or long period of me can influence
        the well-being of those who use the facilies and lead to health
        condions. Worst case, it could lead to irreversible hearing damage.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are known – and renowned – for its excellent sound absorpon properes,
        which help to reduce noise and create good acouscs in every room.
